Task Description: 
Develop a program that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using algorithmic techniques such as backtracking.

The program:

1. Accepts a 9x9 Sudoku grid (with empty cells represented by 0)
2. Fills in the missing numbers to complete the puzzle
3. Displays the solved grid in the console

Algorithm Used:

Backtracking Algorithm:

2. Backtracks when a conflict is found
3. Continues until the grid is completely filled or no solution exists

Technologies Used - 

Language: Java

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

Interface: Console-based (No GUI required)

Features - 

1. Automatically solves any valid Sudoku puzzle
2. Efficient backtracking algorithm
3. Easy-to-read console output
